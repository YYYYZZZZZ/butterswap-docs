# üí° ButterSwap Intro

üçû ButterSwap uses fully open-source smart contracts, and implements the full stack of Automatic Market Making \(AMM\) system, to provide a one-stop liquidity mining platform for crypto investors. 

Users can add token pairs to liquidity pools and obtain the corresponding LP tokens, which then can be used to mine the BUTTER tokens. BUTTER is the platform token for ButterSwap and can only be mined in ButterSwap via LP mining \(a.k.a. Farming\) and BUTTER staking.  For fairness considerations, BUTTER will not be minted before genesis mining, hence all investors get an equal chance of getting BUTTER.

BUTTER staking provides a place to earn more BUTTER by staking BUTTER. In the meanwhile, equal amount of reward token CREAM will be offered to the user, and staking CREAM in the "Pools"  section can earn various partner tokens in the ButterSwap eco-system.

BUTTER will also be used for community decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\). BUTTER holders can vote to decide new token listing, reward reduction, system development, etc.

Currently, ButterSwap only supports Heco Chain. In the near future, BSC, ETH and other chains will be supported to seamlessly integrate assets across various chains.
