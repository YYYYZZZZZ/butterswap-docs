When you go into the dAPP in the top-right corner you can see the different blockchains available, click on it then choose Heco Chain Mainnet.

Create a custom RPC with the following:

Network Name: HECO Mainnet

New RPC URL: [https://http-mainnet-node.huobichain.com](https://http-mainnet-node.huobichain.com)

ChainID: 128

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
