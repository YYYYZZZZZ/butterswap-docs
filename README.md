# üí° ButterSwap Intro

üçû ButterSwap uses fully open-source smart contracts, and implements the full stack of Automatic Market Making \(AMM\) and yield farming system, to provide a one-stop DEX, liquidity mining and yield farming platform for crypto investors. 

BUTTER staking provides a place to earn more BUTTER by staking BUTTER. In the meanwhile, equal amount of reward token CREAM will be offered to the user, and staking CREAM in the Pools section can earn various partner tokens in the ButterSwap eco-system.

BUTTER will also be used for community decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\). BUTTER holders can vote to decide new token listing, reward reduction, system development, etc.

Currently, ButterSwap only supports Heco Chain. In the near future, BSC, ETH and other chains will be supported to seamlessly integrate assets across various chains.
