3. Enter the HECO wallet address and the amount of token to be withdrawn, and confirm the gas fee _\(the gas fee will be much lower than the withdrawal fee for Ethereum\)._  
**Note: When withdrawing asset, select HECO as the chain name, which is the token standard of Huobi Eco-Chain. Don‚Äôt choose any wrong chain, do not fill in the wrong withdrawal address, otherwise it may cause permanent loss of assets.**![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NXG7F4KCuth_AOBzp1Cw1Q.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1278/1*NXG7F4KCuth_AOBzp1Cw1Q.png)
