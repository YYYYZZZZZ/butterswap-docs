# ðŸ’° How to use ButterSwap?

This guide is a recommended step by step guide for beginners to make the best of ButterSwap. [TokenPocket](https://www.tokenpocket.pro/) is used as an example wallet here for the tutorial. However, other wallets, such as Metamask, Huobi Wallet, etc. are also supported, as long as they support Heco chain.

## Step 1 Create Heco wallet and deposit tokens
