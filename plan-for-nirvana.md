# ðŸ¦… Plan for Nirvana

First of all, we feel very bad to disappoint every supporter in this way due to one of engineer's unacceptable mistake.

Second, past is past. We will stand up again and have our nirvana!

Here is the our current plan:

### Step 0 Open portal for non-BUTTER farm and LP.

We will provide website for you guys to unstake non-BUTTER LP from old farms and you can unstake LP to get back your tokens pairs, such as BUT/USDT, HT/USDT. Only for non-BUTTER related LP pairs. For these investors, you do not have any loss.

### Step 1 Take snapshot

We will take snapshot of every LP and every staking. Trust blockchain, information is permanent and we can always get the information accurately.

### Step 2 Deploy new contracts and pre-mint

We will deploy everything in new smart contracts and issue new BUTTER tokens. We pre-mint all the previous valid BUTTER amount and lock it in a cold-wallet protected address.

### Step 3 Open exchange and liquidity

We will then open exchange and liquidity. We will add liquidity there ourselves. And supporters can also add liquidity there at your own wish

### Step 4 Open farms and staking

We will then restore farms and staking. So system can be back to normal.

### Step 5 Give back what you had

We will gradually give back your token pairs contained in the LPs and your staked BUTTERs in different batches. Sorry that we are not able to return everything in 100%, but we will try our best to speed up our pace. Once you get back your LP, you can either farm or unstake LP to get back your tokens. We will give back your staked BUTTER gradually, also in batches. Hope you understand that we don't want panic sell, this makes everyone to lose profit. So we will control the pace to guarantee a healthy development.

### Step 6 Old board member compensation

We will keep board membership and your board entering time. You will get every BUTTER you staked previously. But not at once, we will give them back to you over some time. Hope you understand that this will give positive effects for BUTTER price and is also of your interest. After this, and after we stabilize our operation, we will have plans to compensate board members. 

### Step 7 Every supporter compensation

We will also compensate every BUTTER holder that has not benefited from this accident. If you have benefited from this accident, please contact us \(hi@butterswap.me\) and return the extra benefits and we will give you more in the long term if we stand back again!

We are hoping to reboot the whole system within 3 days and we hope to give back everything belonging to you within 2 weeks!

Sorry again for our mistake!

We will not fall again!
