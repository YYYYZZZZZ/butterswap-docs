# ‚è∞ Auto BUTTER Pools \(beta, in plan\)

If you stake BUTTER in auto BUTTER pools, the earnings will be automagically harvested and restaked \(compounded\) for you periodically. This makes the APR much higher than normal BUTTER pools. A small percent of your total earning, a.k.a performance fee will be subtracted automatically from each yield harvest and burned. By default, you should stake in auto pools for at least 7 days, and if you want to unstake earlier than that, there would be a small amount of early withdrawal fee. The details are as follows:

| Role | Early withdrawal fee within 7 days | Performance fee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Board member | 0.1% | 2% |
| Non-board user | 0.2% | 4% |

Both early withdrawal fee and performance fee will be charged in the form of BUTTER, and these fees will be burned automatically.
