# üéÅ Blind Boxes and BUTTER cards \(early ideas\)

We are thinking about some cool ideas regarding blind box. We are a fan of hearthstone produced by Blizzard, in which, the card can be divided into four categories based on the quality: common, rare, epic, and legendary. Legendary cards are the most valuable and powerful ones. We want to move this brilliant idea into blockchain with the help of smart contracts and NFT.

We will have different NFTs representing different BUTTER cards, each with different quality. Each blind box will open 1 card randomly.

What can these BUTTER cards do? They are powerful! For example, 5x farming card to help you farm five times faster, and 30% percent off card to reduce your transaction fee by 30% in ButterSwap, etc. There are many many different types of cards to be designed.

How can you get these blind boxes? Users can join some prize pool to win blind boxes for free. Blind boxes can also be purchased with BUTTER, and part of the sales revenue will be burned. Board members will be able to buy higher quality blind boxes, with higher possibility to have epic and legendary cards inside.

With the help of NFT, we also plan to open BUTTER card trade market and auction market, so that people can profit from their BUTTER cards. Part of the NFT sales tax will be burned.

These are just some early ideas and let us know what you think and we will gradually improve the system design.
