# üè¶ Board \(expected in a week or so\)

ButterSwap board is a mechanism for DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\) aiming to make the community decide on important decisions, such as next halfing time, and give the BUTTER supporters various rewards and benefits.

## Entering the board

You first stake BUTTER to get CREAM tokens $$1:1$$ , and then you stake $$X$$ CREAM tokens to get DAO tokens $$1:1$$, where $$X$$ is at least $$0.1\%$$ of BUTTER total supply. Now you become a board member of ButterSwap! Once you become a board member, unless you quit board, you will stay in board even if you staked CREAM tokens becomes less than $$0.1\%$$ of BUTTER total supply, which increases continuously. So for early board members, the entering threshold is lower than late board members, which is reasonable.

## Board benefits

### 1. Voting

Only board members can vote on important community decisions, such as next halfing time, tokenomics, etc.

### 2. Board special DAO pools

There will be various DAO pools, similar to CREAM pools, available only for board members. You can stake you DAO tokens to earn in these pools. These pools include DEX revenue sharing pools, special partner airdrop pools, donation pools, NFT revenue sharing pools, etc.

### 3. Lucky Lucky

Each day, there is a special of Lucky Lucky event, in which we give one lucky board member a special gift \( $$1\%$$ of all reward emissions per day, which is 138240 BUTTERs\). You can stake any number of DAO tokens to enter a Lucky Lucky event, and the probability you win is proportional to the number of DAO tokens staked.

### Other benefits coming soon

## Leaving the board

After you enter board, you can choose to add any number of CREAM tokens or remove all CREAM tokens, which makes you quit the board. You can only quit the board 7 days after entering and only on Sunday. After you quit the board, you get back all your staked CREAM tokens, which in turn can redeem your staked BUTTER tokens.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Similar to CREAM token, don't transfer or sell any DAO token. Before you unstake CREAM, you have to unstake DAO first. You have to return the same amount of DAO in order to unstake the same amount of CREAM.
