# BUTTER

BUTTER is the platform token for ButterSwap and can only be mined in ButterSwap via LP mining \(in Farms\) and BUTTER staking \(in CREAM pools\). 

For fairness considerations, BUTTER will not be minted before genesis mining, hence all investors get an equal chance of getting BUTTER.

0.05% of all transaction fee  in ButterSwap's exchange will be collected in ButterSwap treasury account, which will all be used to buy back BUTTER and burn.
