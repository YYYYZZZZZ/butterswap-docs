# üçû BUTTER

BUTTER is the platform token for ButterSwap and can only be mined in ButterSwap via LP mining \(in Farms\) and BUTTER staking \(in CREAM pools\). 

For fairness considerations, BUTTER will not be minted before genesis mining, hence all investors get an equal chance of getting BUTTER. The first ever BUTTER was minted on 2021-6-16.

BUTTER is minted as block number increases. In the future, reward per block may decrease after halfing.
